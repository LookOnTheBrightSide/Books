go to bluemix.net
go to catalog
scroll to service you would like to use
generate credentials

I am using curl here

{
  "credentials": {
    "url": "https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api",
    "password": "your-long-pass",
    "username": "your-long-username"
  }
}

Accuracy was amazing!neat litle toy to play with!


  curl -u "pass": "username" - X POST\
  --header "Content-Type: audio/wav"\
  --header "Transfer-Encoding: chunked"\
  --data - binary@ "./speach.wav"\
"https://stream.watsonplatform.net/speech-to-text/api/v1/recognize?continuous=true"
